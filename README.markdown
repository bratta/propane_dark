# Dark and Simple

This is a Propane theme similar to the Dark Simplified theme from Linkinus, the Mac IRC client. Since Campfire/Propane is different in a lot of ways, there are some obvious differences in the theme, but it is appealing enough to me that I can work with it given the switch from IRC to Campfire as a communications medium.

## Installation

You need *at least* cf_chat.css copied to this folder:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Propane/styles/
    
Or you can clone this repository as the styles directory and pull as changes are made.

## TODO

The speaker icon for playing sounds does not show up. I do not know what CSS declaration handles this, so if you know, send me a message and let me know. I'd love to style that to make it match.
